### Information

Dhaka chapter of Papers We Love was formed in April 2021 to initiate the first Papers We Love chapter of Bangladesh.
Most of the meetups are expected to be online, so your current location or organization would not be a limiting factor.
Meeting platform would vary and depending on the community preferences, might change.
Current options are: Zoom and Google Meet.
We are also considering low bandwidth meet platforms to encourage wider participation.
Lets read more papers and advance our knowledge as well as research!
